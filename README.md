# Experience
Supreme Overlord of Chaotic Media Flux, crafting heuristic vibes and workplace zen at the Ambiguity Nexus, powered by Arch Linux and Vim wizardry. Ex-Guru of Technical Trivia at the Global Dependency Vortex, scripting in Emacs. Prime Lead at CorpCorp.

# Currently Learning
- Industrial Bewilderment Engineering
- Force Push Frenzy (Arch-optimized)
- Cubic Abstraction Overload (Vim-driven)
- Liquification Arts
- Redundant Analytics (Emacs-fueled)
- Rats (cheese-chomping gray bois)

If 'nonsense' trends on GitHub, Iâ€™ll conquer Arch, Vim, and Emacs overnight.
